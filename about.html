    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I'm new to this. Coding. It's seems like hard work but it represents the most complex, interesting puzzle in existence.</p>
    <p>What happens next is a huge experiment. In life. Well, it's all an experiment.</p>

    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I've spent 85% of my life in and around Los Angeles. Home to temperate climate, a wide diversity of food, and lots and lots of traffic.</p>
    <p>Recently I moved. To Boulder, Colorado. Less traffic, fewer food options and a wildly erratic climate.</p>

    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
    <p>I love to cook. And to eat. What could be a better hobby? You get to eat what you make! My next food project is to 'grow' (cultivate) my own yeast for baking bread.</p><p>I also like collecting vintage light meters and have about 300 in my collection. </p>
    <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
    <p>Remote coding, if that allows me to travel periodically but settle in a foreign city for at least a year at a time: Paris, Toykyo, I'm looking at you!</p>
    <h2>What's your shoe size?</h2>
    <p>Okay, odd, but...8<span>1/2</span>...41 in Euro-size.</p>
    <h2>If you could, would you?</h2>
    <p>Yeah, probably. No, wait...I dunno...Trick quesiton?</p>
